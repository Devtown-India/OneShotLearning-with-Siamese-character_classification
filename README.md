# OneShotLearning-with-Siamese

Aim of this  project is to idenitfy similar face charachterstics such as marvel DC_heros,Harry potter,etc

### Aug 6
Tried to understand different techniques for image classification such as Alexnet,Vgg,inception.


### Aug 7
Scrapped data using selenium and collected few samples of data.
Added img_scrape.ipynb file
